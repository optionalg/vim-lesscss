Vim plugin that make it easy to edit less files without need to manually
update corresponding css file.

Just open your `less` file in Vim and edit it. On save corresponding `css`
file will be created with the same name as original.

Use ':Lesscss[!] [cmd] to run predefined command or reuse previous.

Each command is a dictionary that define custom options you want to use
when ':Lesscss' runs, such as less compiler options or output file location.

Command applied globally unless the ! is provided, in which case the command
applied only to current buffer.

For example, to disable Lesscss for all buffers run:

    :Lesscss off

To disable Lesscss only for current one use:

    :Lesscss! off
